Take home project for an interview

I used Python3 with Flask for my backend, and Vue3 for my frontend. Heading into this project I didn't have much or any experience with these particular tools, but took it as an opportunity to learn something new.

To Run:

cd into the server dir
run `python app.py`

cd into the frontend
run `npm run serve --fix`
